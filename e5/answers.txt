1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?

answer:
   Sqrt transformation, as our data was right-skewed. With this transformation I was able to get somewhat
   normal distribution and almost satisfy other assumptions as well:
       1. The samples are representative of the population [check]
       2. The samples are independent and identically-distributed (iid) [check]
       3. The populations are normally-distributed [somewhat-check]
       4. The populations have the same variance [check]

2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing.
   Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion
   would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

answer:
   Original:
   The number of comments posted on weekends and weekdays for each day do differ i.e. the pvalue is small enough that I can reject the null hypothesis. Also, note that both groups fail the normality test.
   
   Transformed:
   The number of comments posted on weekends and weekdays for each day do differ - same argument as above.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original
   question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly
   explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)

answer:
   Mann–Whitney U-test as it can be used to decide that samples from one group are larger/​smaller than another and it assumes only two groups with:

       - Observations are independent.
       - Values are ordinal: can be sorted.

    Both of the above assumptions hold in this case and a small pvalue (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so I can reject the null hypothesis.
   

=========================================================================================

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?

answer:
   On average there are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada on weekdays. However, the sample size of both groups differ by almost 2 folds i.e. comments recorded on weekdays 522 vs comments recorded on weekends 209. So we can't really draw a conclusion in the favor of comments posted on weekdays or vice versa.
