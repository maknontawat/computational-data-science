answer #1.
From the scatter plot there doesn't seem to be any correlation between the density and temperature. As we don't get higher
temperatures for higher densities or vice versa. So, therefore daily temperatures are not a good way to predict population
density.

answer #2.
In modern computers having the CPU decompress the file is faster than reading the decompressed version directly from the disk.
The time it takes to get the decompressed file directly from disk is greater than the time to get the compressed version
from the disk AND have the processor decompress it.

Also from the reference below:
------------------------------
For decompressing compressed data your disks will be the bottleneck. Decompressing is much easier on the CPU than compressing,
so your CPU can most likely decompress data much faster than your disk can hand over the input and write out the
decompressed output.

This is particularly true if you are extracting the archive to a location on the same disk, as the extra head movements
(as they bounce back-and-forth between the location on the disk the archive is read from and the location the output is
being written to) can reduce the read and write speed considerably.
