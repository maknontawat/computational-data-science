answer #1:

Yes, residuals are close enough to being normal. And since the p-value is really small it provides
a strong evidence against the null-hypothesis and we can reasonably conclude that the ratings are
increasing.

answer #2:

Yes, the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true
signal in the noise. Before, Transition = identity for all variables but we replaced the top row
with coefs to make a better prediction, which helped us capture more of the truth.
